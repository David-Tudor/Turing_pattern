A Turing pattern simulation which the user can interact with by dragging a brush to place different chemicals. Diffusion and chemical reactions are simulated, and the latter is specified by the user.

Hidden features:
* Press space to pause/play simulation
* If the number of chemicals is less than 4, the concentrations of each are displayed using one chemical per colour channel (RGB or CYM). Otherwise, the colour of the chemical with the highest concentration is shown at each pixel.
